## Gemini Chatbot - A Simple Python Chatbot using Google Generative AI

This Python script creates a basic chatbot powered by Google's Generative AI API (Gemini-pro). The chatbot interacts with the user, taking text prompts and generating responses using the API.

**Features:**

- User interaction with input prompts.
- Secure storage of the API key using a `.env` file.
- Text responses generated by the Gemini-pro model.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- `google-generativeai` library: `pip install google-generativeai`
- `python-dotenv` library: `pip install python-dotenv`

**Execution:**

1. **Create a `.env` file:**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your Python script.
   - Inside the `.env` file, add a line:
     ```
     API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY` with your actual API key obtained from Google AI Platform.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your Python script and `.env` file.
   - Execute the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python your_script_name.py
     ```
     (Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual filename)

**Usage:**

The chatbot will greet you and prompt you for input. Type your questions or prompts, and the chatbot will respond using the Gemini-pro model. To exit the chatbot, type "exit" and press Enter.

**Functions:**

- `get_user_input()`: This function prompts the user for input and handles the "exit" command. It returns the user's prompt as a string or `None` if the user exits.
- `main()`: This function is the main loop of the chatbot. It initializes the Generative AI model, retrieves the API key from the `.env` file, and enters a loop where it continuously calls `get_user_input` to get prompts, sends them to the Gemini model for response generation, and prints the responses.

**Security:**

- Storing the API key in a separate `.env` file enhances security by keeping it out of the main script code.

**Disclaimer:**

This is a basic example and can be extended to include features like:

- Handling different conversation topics or intents.
- Remembering past conversation history for context.
- Integrating with other APIs for more comprehensive responses.
